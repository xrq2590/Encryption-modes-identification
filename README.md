# Encryption-modes-identification
This is the supplyment codes and dataset for the paper "Encryption modes identification of block ciphers based on machine learning".
The code is compiled by Python 3.7 with the necessary packages such as Tensorflow, Keras.
We upload the block ciphers :AES128, 3DES, ARIA128, PRESENT and SIMON32
The ECB, CBC, CFB,etc modes were gathered into one program.
The machine learning models includes Random forest, etc are also uploaded.
We attach some feature files in order to make you run them easily.
